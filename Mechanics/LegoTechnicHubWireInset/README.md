# Lego Technic Hub wire inset

Based on the "9V Battery Adapter for Lego Powered Up/Control+ Technic Hub"
by 2GodBDGlory (Cole Johnstone). The original work can be found here:

Modified using FreeCAD to be able to hold 0.7 mm wires over the battery contact points, so that a 9V power adapter can be used to continuously power the Lego Technic Hub.
